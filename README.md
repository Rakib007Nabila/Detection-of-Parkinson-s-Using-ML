## Project Overview

This project aims to detect Parkinson's disease using machine learning models trained on biomedical voice measurements. The dataset used is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:

ðŸ”— Parkinson's Dataset

The system evaluates multiple machine learning models **(Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks)** to classify whether a patient is **Healthy (0)** or has **Parkinsonâ€™s disease (1)** based on their voice characteristics.

# Dataset Information
The dataset consists of 23 biomedical voice measurements and one target variable (status):

â€¢	status = 0 â†’ Healthy

â€¢	status = 1 â†’ Parkinsonâ€™s disease


Some key features in the dataset:
 **MDVP:** Fo(Hz) â€“ Fundamental frequency
 **MDVP:** Jitter(%) â€“ Measures frequency variation
 **MDVP:** Shimmer â€“ Measures amplitude variation
 **HNR** â€“ Harmonics-to-noise ratio
 **RPDE & DFA** â€“ Signal complexity indicators
 
# Project Workflow
**1.	Data Preprocessing**
â€¢	Remove irrelevant columns (e.g., patient name).
â€¢	Handle missing values (if any).
â€¢	Standardize features using StandardScaler to improve model performance.
â€¢	Split dataset into 80% training and 20% testing.

2. Model Training & Evaluation:
We implemented and tested four different models:
 Random Forest
 Support Vector Machine (SVM)
 Logistic Regression
 Neural Network (MLP Classifier)
Each model was evaluated using:
â€¢	Accuracy Score
â€¢	Confusion Matrix
â€¢	Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
Feature Selection (Top 10 Features)
To improve performance, Random Forest feature importance was used to select the top 10 most relevant features.
â€¢	Re-trained models using only these selected features.
â€¢	Compared accuracy before & after feature selection.
Hyperparameter Tuning
We applied GridSearchCV for optimal hyperparameter selection:
Tuned SVM Parameters
Code:
'C': [0.1, 1, 10]
'kernel': ['linear', 'rbf']
Tuned Random Forest Parameters
Code:
'n_estimators': [100, 200, 300]
'max_depth': [10, 20, 30]
'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10]
Best Model Selection & Saving
The model with the highest accuracy is automatically saved and loaded for real-world testing.
â€¢	Neural Network (NN) & Random Forest (RF) performed the best.
â€¢	The best model is saved as either .h5 (Neural Network) or .pkl (ML models).
Real-World Testing with New Data
â€¢	Users can input new patient data for prediction.
â€¢	The trained model predicts whether the patient has Parkinsonâ€™s or not.
Code:
predicted_status = model.predict(new_patient_data)
print("Predicted Status:", "Parkinson's" if predicted_status[0] == 1 else "Healthy")
